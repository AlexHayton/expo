Structured Field Values for HTTP, [IETF RFC 8941](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8941), is a proposal to formalize header syntax and facilitate nested data.

Since it is still a work in progress, expo maintains a custom version that only implements the following subset of the protocol defined in [IETF RFC 8941](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8941):
  * All Key values.
  * String, Integer, and Decimal Items.
  * Dictionaries.
